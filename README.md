# Categorizing Grocery products

This simple project aims to solve the following business problem: often, when scraping data from various sources, we find ourselves with information that we can scrape from one source but cannot from the other (missing data). This is especially problematic when a large quantity of the scraped data is missing this specific information, which means that it is not possible to use different Business Intelligence techniques to derive insights using this label as it will lead to skewed results without the bigger picture.

This project uses supermarket data scraped from Hungarian vendors and uses NLP techniques to classify products based on their labeled categories.
